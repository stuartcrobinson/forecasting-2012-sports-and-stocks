This repo contains three projects that I worked on from around July 2012 through Nov 2013

"sports" contains two projects that both predict both the total points and over/under for a basketball game. 
		
		1.  One uses other peoples' wagers. 
		2.  The other uses pure historic scores and multivariate linear regressions in R.  It's a java program that calls R code.

3.  "stocks" is a precursor to seabiscuit that analyzes intraday prices rather than daily prices.
