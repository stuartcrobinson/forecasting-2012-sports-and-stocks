1.  get all new bets.  what if there's a new user???? --- have to update the leaderboard every day

2 am
harvestLeaderboard(league)	-- to see if there are new users.  ALSO to see which users made new bets yesterday
updateUserBets(league)		-- only update those users whose leaderboard data changed.
determineMagicBets(league)	-- try a few different parameters, use the one w/ highest units. 
logMagicBets(league)		-- log to file and to wagerline (needs selenium webdriver)


#######updateUserBets(league)#########
read both oldLeaderboard and newLeaderboard to array.  
for each new user
- get all user bets
make a list of all users whose total num games is different in the newLeaderboard
for each changed user
- get yesterdays bets & append to the user's bets file


#########determineMagicBets(league)########
basically just use Tabulate.java.  pull magicBet from the ranked lists of bets just like "analyze.java" does


#########logMagicBets(league)############

append game data and pending bet to file

log in to wagerline, then save bets here
